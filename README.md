# My dotfiles!
I've been working with a lot of computers recently, so I figured it was time I started synchronizing my dev setups for all of them.

# Install
I have an install script on GitHub Gist. At the moment it requires `ssh-agent` to be running, along with an ssh key preconfigured for my github account.
Then I run this:
`curl -Ls https://gist.githubusercontent.com/three014/2962dcbe47aaf4b5b0a93e76f455b64f/raw/99361da79de463dc690fd847229806953a9db24e/install.sh | sh`
