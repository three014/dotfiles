# My dotfiles!
I've been working with a lot of computers recently, so I figured it was time I started synchronizing my dev setups for all of them.

# Install
Run this! `curl -Ls https://gist.githubusercontent.com/three014/2962dcbe47aaf4b5b0a93e76f455b64f/raw/install.sh | sh`
It installs all the dependencies needed for my favorite programs and tools, and walks me through the steps to setup an ssh key with my GitHub account.
